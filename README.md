+ I'm **NikitoDos**, on Wikimedia Project [**Dnepr740**](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utente:Dnepr740) (last update: 2019).
+ Actually working on: *Kvant* vehicle (Ikarus/Laserfan series), *Spektr* reactor, *Kristall* space stations (under the *Astrodynamics Space Framework*); *Alkaeyne* (pronounced "alkeen") engine.
+ I've also worked on *Starseeker* telescope (2017) and *Script Edge* community (2016-2018) and scale models of spacecrafts (e. g. *ISS* and *Phoenix Mars Lander*).
+ I've been cadet engineer on board merchant and passenger ships and technician in electrical powerplants, and I'm currently a physical sciences merit student.
+ I'm quite expert in space technologies, in particular rocketry and spacecraft design, but also microelectronics, technical physics and thermodynamics, and engines.
+ I like playing the guitar, the electric bass and the piano, and I'm a Microsoft® Windows® and Linux user without any discrimination.
