> Fiery the angels fell; deep thunder rolled around their shores; burning with the fires of Orc.

I'm **NikitoDos**, on Wikimedia Project [**Dnepr740**](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utente:Dnepr740) (last update: 2019), [**ENTJ-T**](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) personality. I'm a Physics student interested in Space and Naval Architecture, member of [UniPV Sailing Team](http://www.sailingteamunipv.it/) since March 2023 as performance analyst and designer, and [BSRC](https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html) intern, at Sardinia Radio Telescope in Cagliari, Italy, since June 2023, as an "alien hunter".

In the past I've been cadet engineer on board [**Amerigo Vespucci**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_training_ship_Amerigo_Vespucci) and technician in electrical powerplants; also, I've created two introductory IT courses, about [ LᴬTᴇX ](https://github.com/nikitodos/latex) and [web design](https://github.com/nikitodos/webdesign_intro), for an Universitary college in Pavia.

> When I heard the learn’d astronomer,\
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,\
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\
Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,\
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\
Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.

Beyond these official assignments, I'm working on a new kind of air/spacecraft, a new concept of inertial nuclear reactor and a different approach to space exploration. Thanks to the technical skills I acquired in high school, I also designed a [telescope](https://github.com/nikitodos/starseeker) and [scaled models](https://github.com/nikitodos/3D_Collection) of famous spacecrafts.
