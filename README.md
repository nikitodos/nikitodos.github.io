# NikitoDos Short Datasheet

> Fiery the angels fell; deep thunder rolled around their shores; burning with the fires of Orc.

I'm **NikitoDos**, on Wikimedia Project [**Dnepr740**](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utente:Dnepr740) (last update: 2019), [**ENTJ-T**](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) personality. I'm a physicist. I'm interested in Space and Naval Architecture and since September 2023 I'm the Team Leader of [UniPV Sailing Team](http://www.sailingteamunipv.it/), after being performance analyst and designer for the same. I've also been a [BSRC](https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html) intern, at Sardinia Radio Telescope in Cagliari, Italy, since June 2023, as an "alien hunter". Actually, I'm working on new developments of that project.

In the past I've been cadet engineer on board [**Amerigo Vespucci**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_training_ship_Amerigo_Vespucci) and intern in an [electrical powerplant]([https://www.gruppohera.it/gruppo/chi-siamo/le-societa-del-gruppo-hera/tamarete-energia-spa](https://www.tamareteenergia.it/)). Moreover, I am the lecturer for two introductory courses in [ LᴬTᴇX ](https://github.com/nikitodos/latex) and [web design](https://github.com/nikitodos/webdesign_intro) since 2022.

Beyond these official assignments, I'm working on a new kind of spacecraft, a new concept of inertial nuclear reactor and a brand new approach to space exploration. Thanks to the technical skills I acquired in high school, I also designed a [telescope](https://github.com/nikitodos/starseeker) and [scaled models](https://github.com/nikitodos/3D_Collection) of famous spacecrafts, that you can see on [my website](https://nikitodos.github.io/). In my free time I enjoy writing music and lyrics.
