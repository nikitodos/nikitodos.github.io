> Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crackpot' than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost. 

> *"The great accomplishments of man have resulted from the transmission of ideas and enthusiasm. The thinker risks the uncertain journey of innovation, challenging the familiar for the sake of the unknown."*  
> — John B. Watson  

According to [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality), I identify as an **ENTJ-T**. I'm a Physicist pursuing studies in Space Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, driven by a passion for space exploration, naval architecture, and innovation. I've always dreamed big about my future, which is probably why I don't think I could ever truly settle. Innovation inspires me the most, constantly driving me to push the boundaries of knowledge.  

In 2023, I embarked on an internship at the [Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC)](https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html), contributing to a research endeavor in the [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence) under the auspices of the University of California, Berkeley. At the Sardinia Radio Telescope in Cagliari, Italy, I delved into the realm of "alien hunting," developing algorithms to apply the [Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosambi%E2%80%93Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve_theorem) on datasets captured in C and K band frequencies. My research focused on galactic nuclei and [a Neptune-sized exoplanet situated within the habitable zone of its star](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/11/aa44079-22/aa44079-22.html). I continue to contribute to this project within the framework of [Breakthrough Listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Listen).  

From September 2023 to July 2024, I held the role of Team Leader at [UniPV Sailing Team](http://www.sailingteamunipv.it/).  

Furthermore, since 2022, I have been an instructor for introductory courses in [LᴬTᴇX](https://github.com/nikitodos/latex) and [web design](https://github.com/nikitodos/webdesign_intro). In my leisure time, I find solace in composing music and lyrics. Notably, I have served as a Cadet Engineer aboard [Amerigo Vespucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_training_ship_Amerigo_Vespucci) and interned at an [electrical power plant](https://www.tamareteenergia.it/). These diverse experiences have significantly influenced the ideas and prototypes showcased on this platform.
