        <h2>Insights Into My Journey</h2>

    <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Giovanni D'Aloisio</strong>. According to <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007BB8;" href="https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">16 Personalities</a>, I am an <strong>ENTJ-T</strong>. As a Physicist pursuing Space Engineering, I strive to see what everyone has seen and think what no one has thought. Fueled by an unrelenting passion for space exploration and innovation, I believe in dreaming big and breaking boundaries to reshape our knowledge.</p>
	
	<p>In 2023, I embarked on an internship at <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #007BB8;" href="https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html">BSRC</a>, contributing to a research endeavor in the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #007BB8;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence">Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)</a> under the auspices of the University of California, Berkeley. At the Sardinia Radio Telescope in Cagliari, Italy, I delved into the realm of "alien hunting," developing algorithms to apply the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #007BB8;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosambi%E2%80%93Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve_theorem">Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT)</a> on datasets captured in C and K band frequencies. My focus laid on galactic nuclei and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #007BB8;" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/11/aa44079-22/aa44079-22.html">a Neptune-sized exoplanet situated within the habitable zone of its star</a>. I continue to contribute to this project within the realm of <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #007BB8;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Listen">Breakthrough Listen</a>.
    
    <p>From September 2023 to July 2024, I served as Team Leader for the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007BB8;" href="http://www.sailingteamunipv.it/">UniPV Sailing Team</a>, and I continue to hold the position of Chief Designer, with my term <em>ad interim</em> set to conclude in July 2025. Since 2022, I have also been an instructor for introductory courses in <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007BB8;" href="https://github.com/nikitodos/latex">LᴬTᴇX</a> and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007BB8;" href="https://github.com/nikitodos/webdesign_intro">web design</a>. In my free time, I enjoy composing music and writing lyrics. I have had the privilege of serving as a Cadet Engineer aboard the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007BB8;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_training_ship_Amerigo_Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> and contributing to operations at an <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007BB8;" href="https://www.tamareteenergia.it/">electrical power plant</a>. These diverse experiences have deeply shaped the innovative ideas and prototypes I share on this platform.</p>
