        <h2>Something about me.</h2>
	
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Giovanni D'Aloisio</strong><!--, on Wikimedia Project <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utente:Dnepr740" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;">Dnepr740</a> (last update: 2019)-->. According to 16 Personalities I am an <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">ENTJ-T</a>. I am a Physicist and a student in Engineering. I am interested in space, naval architecture and astronomy, and I am the Team Leader of <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="http://www.sailingteamunipv.it/">UniPV Sailing Team</a> since September 2023.
        </p>
            
        <p> 
            In 2023 I took part, as an intern at <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html">BSRC</a>, to a research project in the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence">Search of ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence</a>, under the supervision of the University of California Berkeley. At the Sardinia Radio Telescope in Cagliari, Italy, as an "alien hunter", I developed algorithms to implement <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosambi%E2%80%93Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve_theorem">KLT</a> on datasets acquired in C and K band. The main targets on which the test was undertaken were the galactic nuclei and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/11/aa44079-22/aa44079-22.html"> a puffy and hot Neptune-sized planet around the habitable zone of its star</a>.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Moreover, I am the lecturer for two introductory courses in <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://github.com/nikitodos/latex">LᴬTᴇX</a> and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://github.com/nikitodos/webdesign_intro">web design</a> since 2022. In my free time, I enjoy writing music and lyrics. Last but not least, in the past, I have been a Cadet Engineer on board <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_training_ship_Amerigo_Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> and intern in an <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://www.tamareteenergia.it/">electrical power plant</a>. Those experiences gave me most of the inspiration for the ideas and prototypes you can see in this website.
