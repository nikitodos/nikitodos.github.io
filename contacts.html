        <h2>Insights into my journey</h2>

    <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Giovanni D'Aloisio</strong>. According to <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0099cc;" href="https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">16 Personalities</a>, I am an <strong>ENTJ-T</strong>. As a Physicist pursuing Space Engineering, I strive to see what everyone has not seen and think what no one has thought. Fueled by my passion for innovation, I believe in dreaming big and breaking boundaries to reshape our knowledge.</p>
	
	<p>In 2023, I embarked on an internship at <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #0099cc;" href="https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html">BSRC</a>, contributing to a research endeavor in the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #0099cc;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence">Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)</a> under the auspices of the University of California, Berkeley. At the Sardinia Radio Telescope in Cagliari, Italy, I developed algorithms to apply the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #0099cc;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosambi%E2%80%93Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve_theorem">Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT)</a> on datasets. My focus laid on galactic nuclei and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #0099cc;" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/11/aa44079-22/aa44079-22.html">a Neptune-sized exoplanet situated within the habitable zone of its star</a>. I still contribute to the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color: #0099cc;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Listen">Breakthrough Listen</a> project.
    
    <p>From September 2023 to July 2024, I was the Team Leader of the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0099cc;" href="http://sailingteamunipv.wordpress.com/">UniPV Sailing Team</a>. I still hold the position of Chief Designer, with my term set to conclude in July 2025. I have also been a <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0099cc;" href="https://github.com/nikitodos/latex">LᴬTᴇX</a> and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0099cc;" href="https://github.com/nikitodos/webdesign_intro">web design</a> tutor. In my free time, I enjoy composing music and writing lyrics. I have served as a Cadet aboard the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0099cc;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_training_ship_Amerigo_Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> and contributing to operations at an <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0099cc;" href="https://www.tamareteenergia.it/">electrical power plant</a>. These experiences have deeply shaped the ideas and prototypes on this platform.</p>
