            This is the concept of an interplanetary <strong>Space Framework</strong>, aimed to introduce the resources of the Solar System into the current terrestrial economy, speeding up the economic transition in space and improving the safety and flexibility of space flight for space exploration.
        </p>
 
        <p>
            To achieve these ambitious goals, it is necessary to focus on the development of new generation space stations, capable for advanced technological research and tourism and incorporating shipyard-like facilities, a new vehicle for atmospheric and extra-atmospheric transport of people and cargo, and new facilities on the main celestial bodies of the Solar System, for in-situ utilization of resources and working of the same directly in space.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Together with these technological developments, a parallel economic and political work is also needed. Following the release of the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, the actual laws and procedures in space are too weak for granting peace in the context that the framework is aiming to build. Following the development of these laws, the international partner will cooperate to make the program safe and sustainable for further development.

            On this page you can see the official logo of the program and, going on it, an example of modular space station will appear.
