<!-- Ikarus -->

<h2>Project Ikarus Series</h2>

<p>
    <div style="text-align: left;font-size: large;font-family: Libre Franklin;">This is the story of something started in November 2017.</div><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;font-size:x-large;font-family: DotGothic16;">What if the future of space exploration was an upgraded version of the iconic Space Shuttle?</div><br>
    <div style="text-align: right;font-size: large;font-family: Libre Franklin;"> The solution I'm developing on my own is called <strong>Kvant</strong>.</div>

        <h2>Ikarus-X Development</h2>
        <p>
            I started coding, sketching and writing scripts, things and notes, during my classes, in the evenings, while playing the guitar. It came up to me like some concept of hybrid space propulsion: <em>What if I combined electric propulsion with chemical propulsion?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Ikarus-X</em> started in this way, and in just two months of work it had seen the light. <a href="content/reports/DAloisio_Ikarus_X_Final.pdf" target="_blank" title="Sviluppo e costruzione di Ikarus-X" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;">Here</a> it is a report that contains the main details about the project.
            
        </p>

        <h2>Ikarus-Y Development</h2>

        <p>
            In respect to Ikarus-X, Ikarus-Y is a concept of advanced <a style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit" target=”_blank” >SSTO</a> spacecraft. The first idea was to keep the original Ikarus-X design, removing the BLDC propellers and putting something like <a href="https://reactionengines.co.uk/advanced-propulsion/sabre/" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" target=”_blank” >this stuff</a>; however, once the development and design process had been concluded the amount of electric power was prohibitive, as you could expect. Hencefore, it was never been built.
            
            I can't upload any report about this project, due to further development going on. However, the original idea of an all-electric propulsion system cannot be pursued. The new engine I am developing is codenamed <em>Stilo</em>, and a brand-new aircraft based on Ikarus-Y will be its testing platform. On the side, you can see Ikarus-Y in its final form.

<h2>Starseeker Modular Telescope</h2>

            I was 15, when I attended Nautical High School. There I studied elements of celestial navigation, and I found the best field I could ask for to feed my passion in Astronomy and Space Exploration. A friend of mine, who was a shipowner, offered me his machinery to realize the optics of an high resolution telescope, using his heaps of aluminum; this was sufficient to start.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time I had contribute to fix a 30-cm Celestron® telescope built in the 1980s; therefore, the main mechanical parts were derived from it. Inspired by the <a href="https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" target=”_blank” >James Webb Space Telescope</a>, I used all my skills to design the optics. The product I wanted to design had to be some kind of amatorial telescope, using constructive modifications coming from the great Aerospace Industry; the main aim was to gain a deeper understanding on how these things work.
