    <div style="text-align: left;font-size: large;font-family: Libre Franklin;">This is the story of something started in November 2017.</div><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;font-size:x-large;font-family: DotGothic16;">What if the future of space exploration was an upgraded version of the iconic Space Shuttle?</div><br>
    <div style="text-align: right;font-size: large;font-family: Libre Franklin;"> The solution I'm developing on my own is called <strong>Kvant</strong>.</div>

        <h2>Ikarus-X Development</h2>
        <p>
            I started coding, sketching and writing scripts, things and notes, during my classes, in the evenings, while playing the guitar. It came up to me like some concept of hybrid space propulsion: <em>What if I combined electric propulsion with chemical propulsion?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Ikarus-X</em> started in this way, and in just two months of work it had seen the light. <a href="content/reports/DAloisio_Ikarus_X_Final.pdf" target="_blank" title="Sviluppo e costruzione di Ikarus-X" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;">Here</a> it is a report that contains the main details about the project.

        <h2>Ikarus-Y Development</h2>

        <p>
            Regarding Ikarus-X, Ikarus-Y represents a pioneering concept in advanced <a style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit" target=”_blank” >SSTO</a> spacecraft design. Initially, the plan involved adapting the original Ikarus-X blueprint by removing the BLDC propellers and integrating propulsion technology akin to that found in systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)/" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" target=”_blank” >this</a> from Reaction Engines®. However, upon completion of the design phase, it became evident that the energy demands were prohibitively high.

            In response, I am spearheading the development of a revolutionary new engine called <em>Skyraker</em>. A groundbreaking aircraft, built upon the framework of Ikarus-Y, will serve as the testbed for this innovative propulsion system. On this page you can find Ikarus-Y in its final version; more information about the next developments can be found <a style="color: inherit;text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="content/reports/DAloisio_Framework_Rev4.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

            The UniPV Sailing Team, founded in April 2021, embodies the passion for sailing among students at the University of Pavia. The mission is to merge academic knowledge with practical experiences, actively engaging in the internationally recognized foiling week. At the core of the efforts lies the design and construction of <a style="color: inherit;text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://www.moth-sailing.org/">foiling moth</a> boats, with a focus on innovation and eco-sustainability. The group's first creation, Svelta, was crafted in accordance with the <a style="color: inherit;text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://www.moth-sailing.org/">SuMoth Challenge</a> guidelines.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking ahead, I am leading the work on <em>Maya</em>, a next-generation foiling moth set to debut for the <a style="color: inherit;text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://salonenautico.venezia.it/">Salone Nautico di Venezia 2025</a>. Compared to the past, Maya's design marks a clear departure. Heavily inspired by the NASA X-38 Crew Return Vehicle, the design features a pair of smal wings, consisting of six glassfiber panels mounted on an aluminum grid docked to a main frame. These, along with the glassfiber aeroderivative frame, form the load-bearing structure, which bears a much closer resemblance to an aircraft than a traditional boat.
        </p>

        <p>
            To simplify transport and rigging, the non-structural parts, such as the external flax fiber skin and bow, can be removed from the main frame, as well as the wings. With a pair of lightweight alloy bars, each bar is held fixed in the sailing position as if they were all in one piece. Finally, an innovative flight control system allows for optimal wing profile calibration regardless of the availability of electrical power sources.

        <p>At the age of 15, I embarked on a journey at Nautical High School where I delved into the intricacies of celestial navigation. It was there that I discovered the perfect avenue to fuel my passion for Astronomy and Space Exploration. Serendipitously, a friend who owned ships offered me access to his machinery and abundant aluminum resources, igniting the inception of an ambitious project.</p>
        
        <p>Having previously contributed to the restoration of a 30-cm Celestron® telescope from the 1980s, I repurposed its mechanical framework for my endeavor. Drawing inspiration from the groundbreaking James Webb Space Telescope, I channeled all my skills into crafting the optics. My vision was to create an amateur telescope infused with innovations borrowed from the aerospace industry, aimed at fostering a deeper comprehension of these marvels.</p>
