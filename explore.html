            We put into practice the notions learned at university by building <a style="color: inherit;text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://www.moth-sailing.org/">foiling moths</a>: boats that fly. We are constantly researching innovative techniques and materials, to compete at the highest levels with universities from all over the world at the <a style="color: inherit;text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://www.moth-sailing.org/">SuMoth Challenge</a>, an international showcase for our sponsors.
        </p>

        <p>
            The design of our first foiling moth, <em>Svelta</em>, is based on an inner frame in glass and flax fiber able to withstand all the main mechanical stresses. The outer hull pannels, made up of eco-sustainable panels in Flax-PET sandwiches, just close the volume and guarantee buoyancy. All the decorations are done using aesthetic blue flax fiber.

        <p>
            The wings are made with upcycled offered carbon fiber rowing oars. The tubes are connected with bolts and nuts, using pure resin peaces collected from discards. The mast base is made of the fore mentioned broken tubes, which are connected thanks to a flax fiber bond made by hand with no vaccuum, exployting the fiber bonding tension to guarantee a good layer adhesion.
            The mast invitation is made in pure resin from discards, using gypsum as a Bladerider calc and a glass as container during various lamination processes where could be resin excess to discard.

<h2>Project Ikarus</h2>

<p>
    <div style="text-align: left;font-size: large;font-family: Libre Franklin;">This is the story of something started in November 2017.</div><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;font-size:x-large;font-family: DotGothic16;">What if the future of space exploration was an upgraded version of the iconic Space Shuttle?</div><br>
    <div style="text-align: right;font-size: large;font-family: Libre Franklin;"> The solution I'm developing on my own is called <strong>Kvant</strong>.</div>

        <h2>Ikarus-X Development</h2>
        <p>
            I started coding, sketching and writing scripts, things and notes, during my classes, in the evenings, while playing the guitar. It came up to me like some concept of hybrid space propulsion: <em>What if I combined electric propulsion with chemical propulsion?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Ikarus-X</em> started in this way, and in just two months of work it had seen the light. <a href="content/reports/DAloisio_Ikarus_X_Final.pdf" target="_blank" title="Sviluppo e costruzione di Ikarus-X" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;">Here</a> it is a report that contains the main details about the project.
            
        </p>

        <h2>Ikarus-Y Development</h2>

        <p>
            Regarding Ikarus-X, Ikarus-Y represents a pioneering concept in advanced <a style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit" target=”_blank” >SSTO</a> spacecraft design. Initially, the plan involved adapting the original Ikarus-X blueprint by removing the BLDC propellers and integrating propulsion technology akin to that found in systems like <a href="https://reactionengines.co.uk/advanced-propulsion/sabre/" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" target=”_blank” >this</a> from Reaction Engines. However, upon completion of the design phase, it became evident that the energy demands were prohibitively high.

            In response, I am spearheading the development of a revolutionary new engine under the moniker "Project Laserfan." A groundbreaking aircraft, built upon the framework of Ikarus-Y, will serve as the testbed for this innovative propulsion system. On this page you can find Ikarus-Y in its finalized iteration.

            I was 15, when I attended Nautical High School. There I studied elements of celestial navigation, and I found the best field I could ask for to feed my passion in Astronomy and Space Exploration. A friend of mine, who was a shipowner, offered me his machinery to realize the optics of an high resolution telescope, using his heaps of aluminum; this was sufficient to start.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time I had contribute to fix a 30-cm Celestron® telescope built in the 1980s; therefore, the main mechanical parts were derived from it. Inspired by the <a href="https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;" target=”_blank” >James Webb Space Telescope</a>, I used all my skills to design the optics. The product I wanted to design had to be some kind of amatorial telescope, using constructive modifications coming from the great Aerospace Industry; the main aim was to gain a deeper understanding on how these things work.
